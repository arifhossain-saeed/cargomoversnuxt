## Plan Your Move At Least Three Weeks Ahead Of Time

Don’t rush at the last minute trying to find the best moving companies Calgary around the town. If you plan ahead the time, you will not only cut down on stress but also have ample time in order to find the best deal. Try to make your moving appointment in the middle of the week so that you can enjoy your new home on the weekend.

## Be Prepared On Moving Day

Many people make the mistake of thinking that they can simply take off and let the movers do all the things alone. Remember that movers need the person to be around in case anything goes wrong like an item being damaged. Before the movers arrive at your place, ensure that you find the place where they can park their truck and have everything ready ahead of time.

## Complete The Paperwork Beforehand

Make sure that you have received a certificate of insurance as it is going to ensure that the company has insurance in the case that any damage occurs during the process of moving. Get all the paperwork done in advance to avoid the last-minute mess.

## Report Immediately In Case Of Any Damages

Once the move is completed, check all your belonging to ensure that there is no damage. If there is any damage, immediately report it to the moving company. Remember that the longer you will wait to report the damage; there will be fewer chances that your damage will be covered later.

## Notify The Movers About Important Items

Every home has some fragile or valuable items. So it is the responsibility of moving person to notify the movers about such items as the movers will then handle those items with utmost care so that no damage takes place during moving process.

## Keep Boxes Of Reasonable Size And Weight

Never make the box heavier than what you can’t lift. Make sure to keep the boxes balanced as lifting heavy and big boxes is a challenging task for movers also. Therefore, ensure that each box is well secured.

## Be Very Reasonable About What To Take

Many people make a big mistake by taking all the things inside the house. Just take what is needed as taking unneeded junks is a waste of energy, time, space as well as money.

## All The Companies Expect A Tip, Especially If They Did A Good Job
